NAME
----
boothd - The Booth Cluster Ticket Manager.


SYNOPSIS
--------
*boothd* 'daemon' ['-D'] [-c 'config']

*booth* ['client'] {'list'} [-S 'site'] ['-D'] [-c 'config']

*booth* ['client'] {'grant'|'revoke'} [-S 'site'] ['-D'] [-t] 'ticket'  [-c 'config']

*booth* 'status' ['-D'] [-c 'config']


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Booth manages tickets which authorizes one of the cluster sites located in
geographically dispersed distances to run certain resources. It is designed to
be an add-on to Pacemaker, which extends Pacemaker to support geographically
distributed clustering.

It is based on the PAXOS protocol, see eg. 
<http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/lamport/pubs/lamport-paxos.pdf>
for details.



SHORT EXAMPLES
--------------

---------------------
# boothd daemon

# boothd client list

# boothd client grant -t ticket-nfs

# boothd client revoke -t ticket-nfs
---------------------



OPTIONS
-------
*-c*::
	Configuration to use.
+
Can be a full path to a configuration file, or a short name; in the latter 
case, the directory '/etc/booth' and suffix '.conf' are added.
Per default 'booth' is used, which results in the path '/etc/booth/booth.conf'.
+
The configuration name also determines the name of the PID file - for the defaults,
'/var/run/booth/booth.pid'.

*-D*::
	Debug output/don't daemonize.
	Increases the debug output level; for 'boothd daemon', keeps the process
	in the foreground.

*-h*, *--help*::
	Give a short usage output.

*-s*::
	Site address.

*-t*::
	Ticket name.

*-v*, *--version*::
	Report version information.



COMMANDS
--------

Whether the binary is called as 'boothd' or 'booth' doesn't matter; the first 
argument determines the mode of operation.


*'daemon'*::
	Tells 'boothd' to serve a site. The locally configured interfaces are
	searched for an IP address that got defined in the configuration,
	so that Booth can operate in /arbitrator/ resp. /site/ mode.


*'client'*::
	Allows to list the ticket information (see also 'crm_ticket -L'),
	and to revoke or (initially) grant tickets to a site.
+
In this mode the configuration file is searched for an IP address that is 
locally reachable, ie. matches a configured subnet.
This allows to run the client commands on another node in the same cluster, as
long as the config file and the service IP is locally reachable.
+
Example: If the booth service IP is 192.168.55.200, and the local node has
192.168.55.15 configured on an interface, it knows which site it belongs to.
+
The client can also ask another site; use '-s' to tell where to connect to.


*'status'*::
	'boothd' looks for the (locked) PID file and the UDP socket, prints
	some output to stdout (for use in shell scripts) and returns a
	OCF-compatible return code.
	With '-D', a human-readable message is printed to STDERR as well.



CONFIGURATION FILE
------------------

A basic file looks like this:

-----------------------
site="192.168.201.100"
site="192.168.202.100"
arbitrator="192.168.203.100"
ticket="I-want-a-pony"
-----------------------


You can use comment lines, by starting them with a hash-sign (''#'').
Whitespace at the start and end of the line, and around the ''='', are ignored.

The following key/value pairs are defined:

*'port'*::
	The UDP/TCP port to use. Default is '9929'.

*'transport'*::
	The transport protocol to use for PAXOS exchanges.
	Currently only UDP is available.
+
Please note that the client mode always uses TCP to talk to a daemon; Booth 
will always bind and listen to *both* UDP and TCP ports.

*'site'*, *'arbitrator'*::
	Defines a PAXOS member with the given IP, which should be a service IP.
+
You will need at least three members for normal operation; an odd number is 
preferred.

*'ticket'*::
	Registers a ticket. Multiple tickets can be handled in a single Booth instance.

The next items modify per-ticket defaults. They are stored as defaults for 
further tickets, and are used as value for the last defined ticket (if any).

*'expire'*::
	The lease time for a ticket, in seconds. After that time the ticket gets 
	revoked, and another site can get it.
+
Typically 'booth' will try to renew a held ticket after half the lease time.

*'timeout'*::
	After that time 'booth' will re-send packets if there was an insufficient 
	number of replies.
+
The default is '3'.

*'weights'*::
	A comma-separated list of integers that define the weight of individual 
	PAXOS members, in the same order as the 'site' and 'arbitrator' lines.
+
Default is '0' for all; this means that the ordering within the configuration 
file defines a kind of priority for conflicting requests.


A more verbose example of a configuration file might be

-----------------------
transport = udp
port = 9930

# D-85774
site="192.168.201.100"
# D-90409
site="::ffff:192.168.202.100"
# A-1120
arbitrator="192.168.203.100"

ticket="I-want-a-pony"
	timeout = 10
	expire = 600
-----------------------

	

NOTES
-----

Please note that Booth tickets are not meant to be real-time - a reasonable 
'expire' time might be 300 seconds (5 minutes). Due to possible delays on the 
WAN connections it makes no sense to expect detection of problems and failover 
within a few seconds.


'booth' should work with IPv6 addresses, too.


FILES
-----

*'/etc/booth/booth.conf'*::
	The default configuration file name. See also the '-c' argument.

*'/var/run/booth/'*::
	Directory that holds PID/lock files. See also the 'status' command.



EXIT STATUS
-----------
*0*::
    Success. For the 'status' command: Daemon running.

*1* (PCMK_OCF_UNKNOWN_ERROR)::
	General error code.

*7* (PCMK_OCF_NOT_RUNNING)::
	No daemon process for that configuration active.
