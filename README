The Booth Cluster Ticket Manager
    
Booth manages the ticket which authorizes one of the cluster sites located in
geographically dispersed distances to run certain resources. It is designed to
be an add-on of Pacemaker, which extends Pacemaker to support geographically
distributed clustering.
    
Booth is based on the Raft consensus algorithm. Though the
implementation is not complete (there is no log), booth
guarantees that the ticket is always available at just one site
as long as it has exclusive control of the tickets.
