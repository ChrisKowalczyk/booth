=== Simple tests (commandline, config file)


Run

    # make check-TESTS

to run the tests written in python.




=== Unit tests

These use gdb and pexpect to set boothd state to some configured value,
injecting some input and looking at the output.

    # python script/unit-test.py src/boothd unit-tests/
